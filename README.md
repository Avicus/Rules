How to Contribute
-

If you wish to draft a new language, or edit one already on file, you must make a **pull request** so project managers can successfully push your changes. To make a change to this repository, you must **click the file you want to change**. After that, you must make your edits (we use [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)) and **preview the changes** to make sure that they meet the standards of the project. 

After you revise everything, you will be able to **make a proposed file change** (otherwise known as a pull request) by adding a brief description of what you changed, and adding any extra information you want to in the description (such as a note.) You will be able to then propose the file change, and continue on with the push. However, **you must wait for a project manager to push the changes**. They do not appear live automatically.
