### Preface

Disobeying the rules listed on this page while using any Avicus Network service will result in a punishment depending on the severity of the rule broken and is at the discretion of the staff member. Previous infractions will be taken into account when punishing a player.

Although it is not a requirement, we highly encourage all players to use the /report feature in game upon encountering a player who is breaking any of the rules listed on this page. If the player is not in game or the rule broken does not pertain to the Minecraft server itself, please post in the "Report a Player" (https://avicus.net/forums/categories/47) section of the forums.

If you believe a staff member is abusing their power through wrongful punishments or other methods, please post in the "Support" (https://avicus.net/forums/categories/1509) section of the forums.
